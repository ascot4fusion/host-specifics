Host-specific scripts for compiling and running ASCOT5 in different platforms
=============================================================================

Feel free to share your bash and SLURM scripts here.
Make a new folder, with easily identifiable name e.g. <organization>-<cluster>,
for new scripts or update the ones which are no longer working.
Just make sure not to include any confidential information like your username.

Note that `ASCOT5 <https://github.com/ascot4fusion/ascot5>`_ can be run both in
CPU and GPU; typically separate scripts are needed for compiling and submitting
a job.
Therefore it's a good idea to include e.g. suffix "-cpu" or "-gpu" in your
scripts.
